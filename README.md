## 🧠 Philosophy

> "I don’t just solve problems—I design systems that make problems obsolete."

This site is a reflection of my belief that great work is a mix of **communication**, **craft**, and **conviction**. Whether it’s a market strategy or a codebase, I approach it with purpose and precision.
